        "### When university students are forming groups, they are hoping to find those that share similar visions and values to them - but this is far from an easy task. Without knowing everyone in their class, it can be difficult for individuals to find the right group that matches their style -  a concern which university staff have also recognised as seen through the introduction of icebreakers in tutorials. Whilst they can help, they fail to have a substantial impact as the minimal amount of time allocated to icebreakers makes it difficult for students to get to know their colleagues - and so the question must be asked: How can we improve the group-finding abilities of students?\n",

        "*Describe the context in which you are undertaking this project. You should include: any external resources on which your project depends (data sources, website APIs, Python libraries we've not covered in this course, etc.), existing solutions to the same or similar projects, and any other information that the reader needs to know to understand how you intend to solve the given problem.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### One such solution could be an application which allows users to make a mini-profile that could then be accessed through their zID that can be shared to others. It acts as an aid, helping individuals  learn about their classmatess by not only providing more insights in the same amount of time, but also encouraging connection outside of the classroom (since they don't need to be in class to learn about each other). Users can sign-up, login and edit their mini-profile (name, gender, about me, etc.), whilst viewers can seamlessly visit mini-profiles and download them as PDFs / Word Documents. It would enter the market as a differentiated competitor; tackling an audience that isn't tapped by existing solutions like LinkedIn. Selling points include a neutralised-philosophy (ie. LinkedIn is professional), simplification and integration with UNSW services. Google Firebase would be required as a database and authentication system, whilst Flask helps to create the web application. In order to convert the mini-profile to a document, python-docx is required as an additional library.\n",

        "\n",
        "### The target users of this application could be the students of UNSW who have group-related projects that have weightings. However, this could be used in a much more generalised sense as well - being utilised in any situations where people want to learn about each other quickly, like at networking events or for USNW entrepreneurs looking for talent.\n",

        "## Minimum Viable Product/Prototype\n",
        "\n",
        "*Consider what the simplest solution to the problem above would be. For this project, you are not required to produce a completely polished product fit for general use, but you should still take into account usability when deciding viability. In this section, describe a version of your application with the fewest possible features, but which would still be useful to the target users.*\n",
        "\n",
        "### The minimum viable product would have a working login and sign-up system alongside a mini-profile viewer. Elements of the mini-profile would be more bare-bones, perhaps restricted to text, whilst forms of input could be strictly textboxes and buttons. A search function would allow users to search by either ID or by class."
