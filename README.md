# UNSW Mini-Profiles
UNSW Mini-Profiles is a student project by Vietlan Dinh for UNSW COMP1010 2021 T3. The program (built using python, html and css) leverages Firebase to create a light and robust profile system, in which UNSW students are able to search for information on other students and information related to who is in their class. The program was designed to work in Python 3.9.9 and later (accessible via the Windows Store).

After verifying that you have all relevant libraries installed, navigate to **project > main.py** to begin the flask application! As of now, the application supports:

 - Always-online database connection (Firebase Firestore, Cloud Storage)
 - Account Creation
 - Alteration of Credentials (password-only)
 - Profile-editing (including user icons)
 - Profile-viewing
 - Direct & Advanced Search via filters (strengths, courses - separately)
 - Error Prevention
